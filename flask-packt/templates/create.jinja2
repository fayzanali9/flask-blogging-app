<!--the above line shows  title and content in the address bar which isnt good if
    you are sending username and password-->

<!--<form action = "/post/create" method = "POST">-->
<!-- the above line with 'post' attaches info to a hidden payload,also 
    you can send large data here as the amount of characters in a url 
    is restricted and is secure-->  

<form method = "POST">
<!-- removed 'form action' meaning use the current page you are at.The current 
page serves the 'create template' and also takes in the data so we don't need 
an action there.A page giving form to the user and accepting data at same time,
makes things extremely simplified.-->
